# standalone_tools
Basically the place when I want to write things that don't quite belong in [https://github.com/allisoneer/agentic_auxilary](agentic auxilary) and aren't designed to be friendly for other people to use but they happen to be open source still and maybe ai related still but not code agent related.
Also things that are probably not important enough or polished enough to be in their own repo.
